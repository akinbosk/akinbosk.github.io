### About Me

I am a community-based researcher with an interest in phonological theory and phonetics. I have deep experience doing community-based research on endangered and under-resourced languages of Sub-Saharan Africa. My approach to field linguistics involves considering language-external evidence for linguistic theory, so my research also focuses on the connection between language and musi

Coupled with phonological description and analysis of understudied languages, my research uses newer instrumental methods (e.g ultrasound tongue imaging), statistical models and data visualisation techniques to investigate details about phonetic properties of sounds that were not possible to capture through older impressionistic observation methods.


**My Primary research** focuses on phonological description, analysis and theory of African languages. My research is guided by the following questions. Why are some sound-based regularities imposed within particular syntactically defined constituents and not others? Are different types of phonological patterns (vowel harmony, nasalisation, tone mapping, reduplication) subject to comparable restrictions in this regard? Why are ‘size’ requirements imposed on some phonological patterns, for example, the requirement that there be exactly two syllables in some constituent or that a syllable must contain an onset? 


**My secondary research area** is sound-meaning mapping in language and language-external sources. In this case, I am interested in how the morpho-phonological processes mentioned above may be symbolically associated with meaning, challenging the view that non-arbitrary sound-meaning mapping is not an aspect of core phonology. Considering that sound-meaning mapping is an optional aspect of music but an obligatory aspect of language, I also investigate prominent examples of sound-meaning mapping in language-based verbal arts and music, such as the talking-drum languages of West Africa. In talking-drum systems and other speech surrogates, musicians map linguistic meaning to music melodies by imitating linguistic features with musical instruments.  Speech surrogates do not only serve as language external evidence for linguistic theory but afford us the opportunity to investigate language in other modes of communication.  While previous studies on speech surrogates have tended to focus more on musical imitation of language, my research also examine the “opposite”, which involves verbal imitation or interpretation of music melodies.
